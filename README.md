UNCC Online FinTech Bootcamp Module 13

## Executive Summary

I am working as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given me a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I have decided to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

I will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

## Technologies / Installation Guide

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Import the following libraries:

- pandas (an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.)
- Pathlib (a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.)
- scikit-learn (an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.)
- TensorFlow (open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.)
- Keras (an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.)

## Usage

The venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb notebook will be used to complete the following tasks:

- Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
- Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
- Optimize the neural network model.
